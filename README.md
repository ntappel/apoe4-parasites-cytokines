# apoe4-parasites-cytokines
Overview
Apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) is a well-established genetic risk factor for Alzheimerâ€™s Disease in later life, yet it remains prevalent in certain populations. This project explored a key evolutionary hypothesis: that ApoE4 may confer protective effects during early life, particularly in high-pathogen environments, potentially offering a reproductive advantage despite long-term costs.
The goal of the analysis was to determine whether ApoE4 is associated with lower parasitic burden and altered cytokine levels during developmental and reproductive years.

Responsibilities
- Imported and cleaned dataset in R using base R and tidyverse
- Created data frames for analysis and merged across biological variables
- Performed statistical comparisons between ApoE4 allele copies and parasite burden
- Analyzed serum cytokine data (ELISA-derived) relative to ApoE4 genotype
- Visualized results using ggplot2 and presented findings to Principal Investigator

Key Analyses
- Compared parasite counts with the number of ApoE4 alleles (0, 1, or 2 copies)
- Assessed cytokine profiles (e.g., IL-6, TNF-alpha) relative to ApoE4 genotype
- Explored potential immunomodulatory effects of ApoE4 in high-pathogen settings

Notes
Some patterns initially appeared significant in a smaller sample size but trended with increased n, consistent with exploratory findings in evolutionary immunology.
