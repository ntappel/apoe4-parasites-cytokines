# apoe4-parasites-cytokines
Overview of the project:
ApoE4 is strongly associated with Alzheimer's Disease later in life yet still persists in the population. The purpose of this project was to analyze whether ApoE4 offered protection during developmental and reproductive years from parasitic burden at a cost later in life.

Responsibilities:
In this project, I uploaded data files in R studio, created data frames for analysis, analyzed the data in R Studio, generated graphs, and presented finding to my Principal Investigator. 

Key Insights:
- Number of parasites was compared to number of copies of apoe4 in the genome
- Serum cytokine levels obtained through ELISA were compared to apoe4 in the genome
